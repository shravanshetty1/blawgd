<p align="center">Blawgd is a censorship resistant micro-blogging platform.</p>

### Overview
It achieves censorship resistance and decentralization from blockchain technology. A new post, like, follow .etc. are all 
stored on the blockchain.

The light clients (website and apps) verify all data received from nodes of the blockchain network using [merkle proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), making it impossible for any man in the middle to censor information without being detected.

(Currently unimplemented) - All nodes on the network communicate over [TOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network))
 making the network highly resistant to takedowns from external entities.

You can find out more details by going through the [architecture documentation](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Notable features
1. Censorship proof
2. Heavily decentralized
3. Resitant to takedowns (unimplemented)
4. Incentivizes popular posts.

### Status
Network has been released. Browser client is available [here](https://blawgd.com). Apps coming soon.


### Support
